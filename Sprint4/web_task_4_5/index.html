        <p class="article">
          Tennis dates back to 12th century France when it was played in the form of a handball game called 'paume' or palm. The game involved hitting a ball back and forth by hand. In time, a black leather glove was used and then from there a handle was added to the glove, which formed the first racquet.  When it comes to the debate over who is the greatest tennis player of all time, Novak Djokovic isn’t always a popular opinion.

          Perhaps it’s because Roger and Rafa seem to be so universally loved that Djokovic can sometimes be seen as the other guy.
          
          However, Djokovic’s stats are simply unbelievable.

          Novak Djokovic (Serbian Cyrillic: Новак Ђоковић, romanized: Novak Đoković, pronounced [nôʋaːk dʑôːkoʋitɕ] (listen);[6] born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player. He is currently ranked world No. 7 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He has been ranked world No. 1 for a record total 373 weeks,[7] and has finished as the year-end No. 1 a record seven times.[8] He has won 21 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record nine Australian Open titles. Overall, he has won 88 ATP singles titles, which include a record 64 Big Titles and a record 38 Masters titles. Djokovic is the first and only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of the four majors at once across three different surfaces. He is the only man to complete a non-calendar year Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first to achieve a double Career Grand Slam. He is also the only player to complete the Career Golden Masters on the ATP Tour, which he has done twice.

          When it comes to the debate over who is the greatest tennis player of all time, Novak Djokovic isn’t always a popular opinion.

          Perhaps it’s because Roger and Rafa seem to be so universally loved that Djokovic can sometimes be seen as the other guy.
          
          However, Djokovic’s stats are simply unbelievable. In my opinion, if you put a prime Djokovic up against prime anyone else on this list he wins at least 6 out of 10 times.
          
          Whether you think that makes him the best tennis player of all time is for you to decide, but it’s hard to disagree about his backhand being one of the best of all time.
          
          When you throw everything in though, we’ve gone with Nadal, even if Djokovic might end up with the most Grand Slams.
